Validation Approaches
==========

The discussion on validation will emphasize to the attendees the importance and impact of carefully considering how the models are validated for both detection accuracy and temporal accuracy.  We will discuss the importance of cross-subject validation, train/test splits, independence of data sets, and the selection of gold standards. Additionally, a discussion on accuracy reporting, including false-positive analysis, recall analysis, temporal accuracy for event start/end times, and confidence levels will expose the attendees to key differences between this type of data and traditional interpretations.  As with the other sections, examples will be demonstrated in the context of available open-source tools and a running example.
