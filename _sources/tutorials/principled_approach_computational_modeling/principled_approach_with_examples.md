Principled Approach with Examples
==========

This tutorial is designed to help students, researchers, and professionals to introduce rigor in their approach in handling the data diversity and noise that comes from high-frequency sensor data, especially when using them to reliably infer behavioral and momentary contexts. We believe that these techniques will help attendees improve the accuracy and real-world utility of their sensor-derived models.  This tutorial will start with the presentation of a principled approach to doing science and will be followed by the topics below.
