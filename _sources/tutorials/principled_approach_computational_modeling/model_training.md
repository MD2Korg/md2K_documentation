Model Training
==========

This section is dedicated to the techniques needed to cleanly build, test, and adapt models on large-scale sensor data.  We will discuss various considerations including state estimation and event detection, data processing pipelines, interpretability or explainability, generalizability, personalization without new training, and computational efficiency for real-time operation.  We will ground this discussion in available open-source tools and use an example from the mOral open dataset. We will show the benefits of these techniques through the impact and quality of the generated results.
