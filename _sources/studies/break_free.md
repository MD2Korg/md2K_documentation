Affective Science
====================

## Description
The use of ecologically valid, in the moment reports (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) of
emotion and context have contributed critical information necessary to create models related to risk of
smoking lapse. However, research to date has often focused on negative affect and stress as overarching
constructs, and there are almost no data addressing the association of distinct emotions and their
temporal dynamics on smoking outcomes in real time in the real world, or whether the associations
between emotions and outcomes are modified by context and/or intrapersonal factors. In addition,
objective, unobtrusive indicators of self-regulatory processes and smoking outcomes could provide
unique information that complements self-report EMAs. Thus, the overarching objectives of this
research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct
emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to
develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target
real time, real world mechanisms.
