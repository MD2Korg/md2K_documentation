Cerebral Cortex
=======================

Cerebral Cortex is the big data companion of mCerebrum designed to support population-scale data analysis, visualization, model development, and intervention design. It is capable of scaling 1,000s of concurrent mCerebrum instances and supports machine learning model development on population-scale data sets and interoperable interfaces for aggregation of diverse data sources. Currently Cerebral Cortex supports 10 concurrent studies combining 2,100+ participants, 100,000+ person-days of data and 4.7 trillion data points (100+TB).
