Mobile Assistance for Regulate Smoking
====================

## Description
Empirical evidence suggests that engaging in evidence-based self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) can improve the ability to resist temptations and build self-regulatory skills. As a result, self-regulatory activities are key components in many smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time-Adaptive-Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Vulnerability (e.g., risk for lapse) and receptivity (i.e., ability and willingness to utilize a specific intervention) are two theoretical constructs that play a critical role in the formulation of effective JITAIs. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of JITAIs that are designed to increase smokers’ self-regulatory activities.
