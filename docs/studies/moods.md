Mobile Open Observaion of Stressors
====================

## Description
This study aims to answer several key questions in the computational, clinical, and data science domains. Computationally, we want to study how computational models can detect, distinguish, and/or predict key stressors (i.e., stress event precipitants) from sensor data in peoples’ day-to day lives. Next, clinically, we expect to observe within- and between-subjects differences in stressor “phenotyping” – as has been documented in the phenotyping of stress. We want to know whether these phenotypes can be used to develop new, temporally precise stress interventions. Finally, we want to explore what structures, functions, and queries of metadata underpin our predictive capacity, not just for stressors, but for mHealth and mobile sensing more broadly: We want to investigate the capacity for building and testing an effective structure for mHealth metadata that can inform a variety of mHealth use cases, e.g., including (1) privacy (i.e., of data collection) and (2) data missingness/deterioration (i.e., how should data missingness – including from engaging privacy functions – be annotated?).
