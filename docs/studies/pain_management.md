Pain Management
====================

## Description
The software is requested to collect data from participants with chronic pain and who use opioids. This software, in conjunction with wearable (mobile) sensors, will be used to develop models for the passive detection of pain, pain flares, and/or opioid use.

- Conduct a lab/field study to objectively detect pain and opioid use among a population of sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients who are also consistent users of opioid pain medications.
- Use mobile sensing to detect physiological responses to pain and opioid use, as well as EMA questions in key domains of pain and opioid use science.
  - Using psychological and physiological parameters, captured through MD2K sensors, to detect pain flares in temporal proximity to when they happen
    - Distinguish pain flares in relation to psychosomatic stressors
    - Characterize opioid use predictors through the use of MD2K sensors
    - Link between pain and opioid use; defining the gap
    - Use development for stress model
