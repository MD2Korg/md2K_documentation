Computational Pipeline
==========

Transforming data from one form to another (e.g., detecting hand to mouth gestures from wrist-worn inertial sensors) is a critical preprocessing stage before getting to the modeling and validation steps. There are many nuances (e.g. windowing, data cleaning, filtering) associated with performing these data transformations which will be discussed in the context of published works and grounded with real data examples.  We will show the benefits of these transformations by writing custom feature transformations on the mOral dataset.
